  <h4 class="orange text-center">Optimize Your Existing Enterprise Systems with Business Process Management (BPM)</h4>
  <p>Enterprise systems degrade over time. Processes are added without proper testing. Software components drop into obsolescence with surprising frequency. Systems become inefficient, resulting in errors and the inability to adapt to changing business needs.
 </p>
 <p>At CNET Global Solutions, Inc., we put our best resources to work for you in the rapidly expanding field of Business Process Management (BPM). With our cutting-edge BPM solutions, we will align all aspects of your organization to match the expectations of your customers, users, administrators, and other stakeholders. We employ this innovative, holistic management approach to make your technology systems more effective and more adaptable than most traditional hierarchical management approaches. The positive impact of BPM on organizational efficiency has been demonstrated time and time again, and our technology will support your process management especially in times of stress and change.</p>
 <p>We set up BPM processes for you through all major phases of your system's lifecycle:</p>
 <p><strong>Design </strong>- We integrate your existing systems with newly designed systems developed by our software engineers for your specific needs. We focus on the facets of the system-to-be, from the process flow, the human operators, alerts and notifications, escalation procedures, standard operating procedures, service level agreements, to task hand-over. </p>
  <p><strong>Modeling</strong> - We run comprehensive "what-if" scenarios to test every variable and push the limits of the entire process. </p>
 <p><strong>Execution </strong>- We implement the latest IT software to put the processes into immediate use. </p>
 
 <p><strong>Monitoring</strong> - We provide the reporting and notification systems that let your key administrators know the moment a human action is required. Our software solutions track and gather data to analyze performance metrics as your systems run.</p>
 <p><strong>Optimization</strong> - The accumulated data, results of the "what-if" scenarios, reports, and execution data are used to identify current and future bottlenecks and compensate, leaving you with the most efficient system. Pain points are identified early and corrected before costly problems arise.</p>
 <p>At CNET, we employ our BPM technology solutions in your critical processes to gather comprehensive operational intelligence and give you real-time, actionable information. But we don't just stop with BPM; we integrate your systems with emerging Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) to take your productivity ever further.</p>
